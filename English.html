         Associate Professor and Master Supervisor of Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications(CQUPT). I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2017. Before joining CQUPT in 2017, I was a Data Engineer at Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company from 2011 to 2013. I have published more than 30 refereed papers, including Information Sciences, Knowledge-Based Systems, Neurocomputing. Also, I have applied for more than 10 national invention patents, 5 of them have been authorized. And in the meanwhile, my first monograph about data analysis has been published by Tongji University Press (TJUP).
I received the Science and Technology Progress Award of Sichuan Province, Best Reviewer for international journal Knowledge-based Systems (KBS), and Excellent Teacher Award of CQUPT. I am the member of Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) , China Computer Federation (CCF), and board member of Social Computing and Social Intelligence Committee of CAAI. I am also the reviewer of international journals including Knowledge-Based Systems,China Communication, Physica A, IEEE Access, Computers & Electrical Engineering, International Journal of Modern Physics, Tsinghua Science and Technology, Cybersecurity.<br />
